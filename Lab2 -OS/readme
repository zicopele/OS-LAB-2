## Installation
        To install and compile this program, you will need to install a virtual machine and also the make function, as we are using a makefile. (sudo apt-get install make)
        Now, in your terminal use the command "cd /path/to/directory" to move into the directory where the code is located.
        Once in the correct directory, use the following command: "make". This will compile the files for the program.
        At last, run the command "./myshell"
